    "With this FRQ, I realized that this could be made into a game. While I did complete the required tasks, I also added some features so that it could become a playable game, such as a random word generator from RapidAPI and also recurrence so that the user can continually play it until they guess the word. The responses are recorded in order for the user to see their progress towards the correct guess. I decided to make this game by first completing the original task, where I had to display a hint based on the words that were given vs the actual answer. I did this in the `getHint` method, where I check if the letters in the word match with the letters of the guessed word. There are three conditions, one where the placement is correct, one where the placement is off but the letter exists, and one where neither the placement or the letter is correct. I do this by iterating through each letter in the guessed word with a for loop and checking them against the actual word. I also make a `containChar` method which is used to check if the character is actually contained in the word at any place. I also added a fetch method, which uses code from RapidAPI and a transform method, which changes the JSON from the API into a string that can be used in the game."
