I did digital media production before and it is interesting seeing other students complete the same projects differently from how I did. I also saw the photography class which was also interesting to see how new photographers are beginning. I have done photography for 10 years and see some mistakes that they make in their composition or their lighting and it is interesting how some small details are missed by new photographers."
